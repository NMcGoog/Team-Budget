Setting external libraries seems to not work automatically. 

ADDING COMMONS.LANG3 LIBRARY
To add the Apache Commons Lang3 package dependency to the project in NetBeans, 
navigate to "Libraries" in project directory, right-click and select 
"Add JAR/Folder" and then place this .jar file there. It can be found in
this folder (ibas/Commons) inside the project directory.

ADDING MYSQL JDBC DRIVER
The same goes for the MySQL driver. It needs to be added in a similar way:
Right-click "Libraries" and select "Add Library" and then select "MySQL JDBC Driver"
and add it to the project.
